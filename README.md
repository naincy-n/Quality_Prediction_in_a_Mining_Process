My project was Quality Prediction in a Mining Process.

Main objective is to Explore real industrial data and help manufacturing plants to be more efficient

## DATASET

This dataset is about a flotation plant which is a process used to concentrate the iron ore. This process is very common in a mining plant.


This internship gave me a very good opportunity to get exposure to Industrial problems and design/implement solution for that. It was an overall great experience to have this internship.
